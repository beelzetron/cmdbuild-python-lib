# cmdbuild-python-lib
Python library to access the REST interface of a CMDBuild server.

This is a Python implementation of (some of) the CMDBuild rest interface.
This is not a complete library but should contain more than enough code 
to get you started.

You will find PyDoc generated doc in cmdbuild.html

Requires CMDBuild v2.3.0 or higher - older versions lack the REST v1 API.

Good luck.
